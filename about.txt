1. In order to have backend running, created app/api/test/route.tsx
2. In order to consume that backend function, in the FE component:
    const repos = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/test")
3. The application was behaving weird, it turns out I discovered it was code in memory/cache.
To solve that, I simply removed /.next
* the cached code did not performed on Postman (it was working as expected). 
  But in Chrome and Firefox, it was running the cached code.

4. Route is been done by creating /app/test/page.tsx
When browsing, type 'application-address'/test

??? how to access the api internally withouth knowing its name/port???
